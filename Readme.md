# ScanPorts

This simple python port scanning script uses the socket module to scan ports on and off a network. The user will specify the IP address as an argument on the command line and the range of ports to be scanned. The program will then iterate through each port and test whether it is open or closed, providing informative output as to which ones are open. These functionalities allow the user to make informed decisions about their security configuration.

### Example

- Windows:
py portScan.py 127.0.0.1

- Linux:
python portScan.py 127.0.0.1
